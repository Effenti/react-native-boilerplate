# Effenti's React Native Boilerplate
This is our very own React Native recipe for success! In this repo you'll find an empty react-native project, with all the essential packages. This boilerplate offers the following:

* Navigation
* Carousel
* Icons

## Getting started

### Step 1

Create the react-native project:
```react-native init myProjectName```

### Step 2

Build the react-native project:
```react-native run-ios```

### Step 3

Profit!

## Creating the app icons

We use MakeAppIcon for this:
https://makeappicon.com/

Please have your app icon in the PNG format at a 1536x1536 resolution for best results.

## Navigation

The package for the navigation is React Navigation:
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/intro/quick-start

## Carousel

We recommend using react-native-swipeable-parallax-carousel:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-swipeable-parallax-carousel

## Icons

We recommend using react-native-vector-icons which supports a lot of different icons:
